#This is to add ideas that may come in the devt stage 

-idea1 => Add a type to check the issue type (for now project and task)

	 When you creat an issue check if it's a projec or task from the type drop down that was created 
	 
	 Change the view of projects to be a dropdown'ish (look into this more)

	 If it's a project create a new project, if it's a task ask which project it belongs to (from the exisiting projects)

	 If it's a task add it to the projec it needs to go to

	 Add an original time estimated to finish that task and print it on the ui
		
	 Add a inprogress and done (we alread have this, just add an update button so it can take to the page where we can update it)			
		

-idea2 => login page for users (and admin)

-idea3 => give access to users suing their email address and send an email to the user when an access has been granted to a project
